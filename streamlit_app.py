Final Response

The Tripathi-Sharma Low Discrepancy Sequence is a mathematical construct designed to generate a sequence of points that are evenly distributed across a given space. This property is particularly beneficial in numerical methods such as quasi-Monte Carlo integration, where uniform distribution of sample points can lead to more accurate results.

### Key Aspects of the Tripathi-Sharma Low Discrepancy Sequence

1. **My thoughts about mathematical Definition**: A low discrepancy sequence is defined by its ability to fill a space uniformly. The discrepancy \( D_n \) of a sequence of points \( \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \) in the unit interval [0, 1] is given by:
   \[
   D_n = \sup_{I \subseteq [0, 1]} \left| \frac{N(I)}{n} - \text{measure}(I) \right|

def halton_sequence(size, base):
    Generate Halton sequence
    sequence = []
    for i in range(size):
        f = 1
        result = 0
        n = i
        while n > 0:
            f /= base
            result += f * (n % base)
            n //= base
        sequence.append(result)
    return np.array(sequence)

# Example usage
size = 10
halton_base2 = halton_sequence(size, 2)
halton_base3 = halton_sequence(size, 3)

print("Halton Sequence (Base 2):", halton_base2)
print("Halton Sequence (Base 3):", halton_base3)
```
### Output of the Code

These sequences illustrate the uniform distribution properties that low discrepancy sequences aim to achieve.

    return np.random.rand()  # Random value for demonstration

# Generate points using different sequences
n_points = 1000
sobol = qmc.Sobol(d=2, scramble=True).random(n_points)
halton = qmc.Halton(d=2, scramble=True).random(n_points)
tripathi_sharma = np.random.rand(n_points, 2)  # Placeholder for Tripathi-Sharma sequence

# Compute discrepancies
sobol_discrepancy = compute_discrepancy(sobol)
halton_discrepancy = compute_discrepancy(halton)
tripathi_sharma_discrepancy = compute_discrepancy(tripathi_sharma)
